Welcome to this simple key debouncer/keyboard chatter removal tool repo! This program listens for keyboard input and prevents duplicate keys from being accidentally registered within a given time window.

Currently only supported on Windows, but the base repository this project was forked from has example keyloggers for Mac and Linux as well, so the basic work of "capturing keyboard input" is at least in place there.
